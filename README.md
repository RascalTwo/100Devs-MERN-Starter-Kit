# 100Devs-MERN-Starter-Kit
A demo repo with the deployment setup/basic architecture of the 100Devs Together project. Good template for starting a MERN project!

# Roadmap:
~~- Implement Discord Authorization~~
- Have certain features only appear if authorized
- Set Up "Example" Object for API
- Implement CRUD functionality for the "Example" Object

# Tech Used:
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Passport
- Discord Authentication

# Initialization
- Clone the repo
- Run ```npm install``` in the root folder to install the server dependencies
- Run ```cd client``` then run ```npm install``` to install the client dependencies
- Run ```npm run start``` to run the app. The client and server will then run concurrently.
